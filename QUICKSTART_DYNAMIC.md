## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

   # Kill processes if needed
   pkill -f "python.*agent"
   ```

2. **OpenAI API errors**
   ```bash
   # Check your .env file
   cat .env
   # Make sure OPENAI_API_KEY is set
   ```

3. **Form not loading**
   ```bash
   # Check if form server is running
   curl http://localhost:8080/business_input_form.html
   ```

4. **Analysis taking too long**
   - Check agent health: `curl http://localhost:5099/health`
   - Increase timeout in your client
   - Check OpenAI API rate limits

### Health Checks

```bash
# Core agent
curl http://localhost:5099/health

# Individual agents
curl http://localhost:5001/health
curl http://localhost:5002/health
curl http://localhost:5003/health
curl http://localhost:5004/health
curl http://localhost:5005/health
curl http://localhost:5006/health
curl http://localhost:5007/health
curl http://localhost:5008/health
```

2. **Add New Business Types**: Extend the system with industry-specific analysis
3. **Integrate with External Data**: Connect to market research APIs
