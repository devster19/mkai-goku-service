# Business Automation System

## Overview

The Business Automation System is an intelligent task management and monitoring system that automatically tracks business performance, executes scheduled tasks, and triggers re-analysis when goals aren't being met.

## Features

### üéØ **Automated Goal Monitoring**
- Tracks business KPIs and performance metrics
- Monitors progress against set targets
- Automatically identifies when goals are at risk or behind schedule
- Triggers re-analysis when performance falls below expectations

### ‚è∞ **Scheduled Task Execution**
- **Daily Tasks**: Sales performance analysis, KPI monitoring
- **Weekly Tasks**: Market analysis, financial reviews, trend analysis
- **Monthly Tasks**: Strategic goal reviews, budget adjustments, brand monitoring

### ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Task Distribution**
- Strategic Agent: Market analysis, goal reviews
- Financial Agent: Financial reviews, budget adjustments
- Sales Agent: Sales performance, customer feedback
- Analytics Agent: KPI monitoring, trend analysis
- Creative Agent: Marketing performance, brand monitoring

### üìä **Real-time Dashboard**
- Visual progress tracking for all business goals
- Task execution status and history
- System-wide automation summary
- Recent activity monitoring

## How It Works

### 1. **Business Creation**
When a new business is created through the analysis system:
- Automated tasks are created for each agent based on business type
- Initial business goals are set (revenue, customers, profit margin, etc.)
- Task frequencies are adjusted based on business type (startups get more frequent monitoring)

### 2. **Task Execution**
- Tasks run automatically based on their configured frequency
- Each agent receives specific tasks with relevant parameters
- Results are used to update business goals and performance metrics

### 3. **Goal Monitoring**
- System continuously monitors goal achievement
- Progress is calculated as percentage of target value
- Status is updated: "on_track", "at_risk", "behind", or "achieved"

### 4. **Re-analysis Triggering**
When goals are not being met:
- System identifies the specific issues
- Triggers a new comprehensive business analysis
- Provides context about why re-analysis was needed

## Business Goals

### Common Goals (All Businesses)
- **Revenue Growth**: Target 1M THB annual revenue

### Business-Specific Goals
- **Tech Startups**: User growth (1000 active users)
